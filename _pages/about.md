Welcome!

I’m Laura Wagner, Associate Professor in the Operations, Information and Technology Department at [IESE Business School](https://www.iese.edu/). Before joining IESE, I taught everything from undergraduate to executive MBA courses at Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics. My academic journey has taken me across Europe — I earned dual degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Economics from the Technical University of Graz, an MBA from the University of St. Gallen, and a PhD from the MIT-Zaragoza Logistics Center. Along the way, I spent time at MIT, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and a postdoc year right here at IESE.

My research blends theory, data, and real-world insights — focusing on assortment planning, consumer choice, and causal inference in retail. I love collaborating with fashion and grocery retailers (and more recently telecom companies) to tackle complex, data-driven challenges.

You can find my work in top journals such as Operations Research, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, and European Journal of Operational Research.

Before academia, I worked in the real world of operations — from logistics consulting to product and program management at Bosch Rexroth, ThyssenKrupp Presta, and others.
